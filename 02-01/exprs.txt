#Question 1
#Short is the length of the integer. Short is not longer than int and is
#usually 16 bits
#Int is the natural size of integers-between 16 and 32 bits 
#Float is a single precision floating point
#Double is a double precision floating point

(don't know how to test these)

#Question 2
#int main(void) {
 float y = (2 + 5)/2;
  printf("%f /n",y);
  }
  
3.000000
because float rounds the answer

#Question 3
#int main (void){
int i = 0;
int j = 0;
int x = i++;
int y = ++j;
printf("%d %d\n"i,j,x,y)
}

#answers are i=j=y=1, x=0

#Because ++j increments j before its value is used and so x=1
#++i increments i after its value is used so i is 0.
